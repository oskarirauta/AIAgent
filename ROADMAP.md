# Roadmap

Development history and forward-looking ideas for AIAgent. The **Done** sections
record what shipped (kept for context); the only outstanding work is under
**ROADMAP TO V2** near the bottom. **Considered / dropped** lists ideas
deliberately left out.

## Done

- **Providers**: OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, Moonshot, Kimi, Claude — with
  subscription OAuth (Bearer token) for Kimi and Claude, not pay-as-you-go API keys.
- **Streaming everywhere**: every turn streams (even with tools). Content,
  reasoning and tool calls are assembled from the stream (`stream_reset` /
  `parse_stream` → `StreamChunk` / `stream_result`).
- **Thinking / reasoning**: captured for Kimi (`reasoning_content`) and Claude
  (thinking block); Claude extended-thinking wired (effort → `budget_tokens`,
  `max` = model ceiling); Kimi `xhigh`/`max` normalised to `high`. Reasoning
  streams live, dimmed, behind a 💭 marker; `/stream off|on|collapse` toggles it —
  collapse shows the reasoning live then hides it once the answer is done.
  (Note: Claude's OAuth API redacts thinking text, so only Kimi shows a transcript.)
- **Current date** injected into the system prompt (so the model needn't call `date`).
- **UI**: inline REPL (native scrollback, no ncurses), colour themes
  (dark/light/warm/cool/rose), multi-line prompt mode, interactive `/settings` menu,
  visual `/context`, arrow-select tool confirmation.
- **Context management**: `context_limit` trimming, `context: auto` (per-model window).
- **Tool safety**: confirm / auto / insecure modes, danger list, chain-aware safe
  list, `strict` mode.
- **Persistence**: per-provider + per-project history and memories; UI settings
  (theme, multiline, thinking, thinking_stream/collapse, context, auto_compact,
  paste_preview) saved to `state.json`.
- **Paste preview**: `paste_preview` trims a framed paste's echo to the first N
  lines + "… N more lines" (full text still sent to the model).
- **Slash commands**: `/about /settings /model /tools /strict /thinking /theme
  /stream /history /retry /undo /memories /context /compact /clear (/reset) /help`.
- **`/compact`**: one LLM call summarises the history and replaces it; runs async
  with a "compacting" spinner (Ctrl-C cancels).
- **Auto-compact**: when a turn leaves the context at/above `auto_compact_pct`
  (default 80%) of the context budget, the history is summarised automatically
  (same async path as `/compact`, labelled "auto-compact" in the transcript).
  Off by default; toggle with `/settings auto_compact on|off`. Inactive unless a
  context budget is known (`context: auto` or an explicit limit).
- **SIGWINCH**: the live block redraws at the new width on terminal resize.
- **Line editing**: the inline REPL supports Ctrl-A/E (line ends) and Ctrl-W/U/K
  (delete word / kill to line start / kill to line end), respecting logical line
  boundaries and pruning removed paste placeholders.
- **`/advisor`** (claude only): exposes a `consult_advisor` tool so the main model
  can ask a stronger sibling model (e.g. sonnet → opus) for a second opinion on a
  hard problem. `/advisor <on|off|model <name>>`; the consult is a one-shot,
  non-streaming call on the same OAuth session with the model temporarily swapped.
  Gated by the `advisor` provider capability; the tool is registered only while
  on and removed on a switch away from claude.
- **`/btw <note>`** (alias `/note`): add a note to the context as a user message
  without asking for a reply — the model sees it on your next turn. Consecutive
  same-role messages are merged in the Anthropic request so this can't break
  Claude's strict user/assistant alternation.
- **`/provider <name>`**: switch provider mid-session, carrying the current
  conversation over (system prompt refreshed to the new provider's identity).
  Re-auth is non-interactive (`ready_noninteractive`): a subscription provider
  with no cached token is refused with a hint to relaunch with `-p <name>`,
  rather than blocking the raw-mode REPL on an OAuth prompt.
- **`/workflows`** (claude only): a `run_workflow(name, steps[])` tool lets the
  model launch a background workflow — each step is an independent read-only
  sub-agent (own client/provider/conversation, read/list/grep tools, no re-auth).
  Runs execute on background threads (`WorkflowManager`); the tool returns a run
  id immediately. `/workflows` lists runs + progress, `/workflows <id>` shows step
  results. Finished runs are folded into the conversation at the next turn's start.
  NOTE: lightweight single-machine version — steps can run in parallel and results
  are folded in on completion (with a bell notice or opt-in autoresume); full cloud
  orchestration is a V2 item.
- **Project instructions**: a project-local `AGENTS.md` (or `.ai-agent.md` /
  `AGENT.md`) in the working directory is read into the system prompt (after the
  long-term memories), so a project can pin coding style, testing conventions and
  constraints without repeating them each session. Read fresh from the cwd (size-
  capped); `/about` shows which file is loaded.
- **`project_map` tool**: a high-level project overview on demand — build/manifest
  files parsed (package.json name/scripts/deps, Cargo/pyproject name+deps, go.mod
  module, Makefile targets [object/phony filtered], CMake project), the top-level
  directory layout with per-dir file counts, and a source-language histogram.
  Skips build/vendor dirs; cheaper than exploring with many list/read calls.
- **OpenRouter provider**: OpenAI-compatible gateway to many models
  (`vendor/model`, incl. `:free` variants). A thin `OpenAI` subclass — default
  endpoint `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, Bearer auth, plus OpenRouter's optional
  `HTTP-Referer`/`X-Title` attribution headers. (DeepSeek, Gemini, Groq, Mistral,
  xAI etc. work through the `openai` provider with a custom `api_url` — documented
  in the README's OpenAI-compatible table.)
- **Diff preview in the confirmation dialog**: `write_file`/`edit_file` confirms
  show what would change — a block diff of the file vs the new content (write_file)
  or the -old/+new snippets (edit_file, each multi-edit entry), coloured like a
  diff — instead of a raw args dump. `block_diff` moved to `text_utils`, shared
  with `/changes`.
- **`/tasks`** (agent todo list): an `update_tasks` tool the model calls to keep a
  short plan (title + status pending/in_progress/done) for multi-step work; `/tasks`
  renders it with ✓/▸/○. Session-scoped, provider-agnostic.
- **Autocomplete**: Tab in the inline REPL completes a leading slash command or a
  file-path token — unique match completes (dirs get `/`, else a space), a shared
  longer prefix extends, and an ambiguous prefix lists the candidates.
- **Config-extensible danger/safe command lists**: `tools_safe:` / `tools_danger:`
  config keys (comma-separated). Extra safe commands skip confirmation (pipes and
  chains included); extra danger programs always warn — checked on the real
  program (wrapper unwrapping applies), danger wins if a name is on both lists.
  Config file only, never persisted state or project files.
- **`/workflows` enhancements**: parallel steps, per-run cancel + retry (succeeded
  steps kept), completion notice (bell + ●-line), and opt-in autoresume — a
  finished workflow starts a turn by itself via the normal pending queue, bounded
  to 2 consecutive auto-turns per real user message.
- **Context pin (`/pin`)**: `/pin <text>` (or `/pin` alone to pin the last reply)
  keeps a note in the system prompt, so it stays in context every turn **and
  survives `/compact` and auto-compact** verbatim (compaction rebuilds the system
  prompt, which carries the pins). `/pins` lists them, `/unpin <n|all>` removes.
  Session-scoped. For "don't forget this decision / constraint" that must outlast
  summarisation.
- **`/plan` (read-only planning mode)**: `/plan on` (or bare `/plan` to toggle)
  blocks every mutating tool — write_file, edit_file, run_command, non-read-only
  MCP tools — so the model investigates with read-only tools and proposes a plan
  instead of acting; a refused call tells it to present the plan. A system-prompt
  note primes the model, the status line shows "· plan", and `/plan off` restores
  writes. `!command` passthrough still works (it is user-driven). Session-only.
- **Attention cues**: when a confirm dialog appears after the turn has already
  run unattended (≥4s), the terminal bell rings once — the agent is blocked on
  you. And a turn that ran ≥8s ends with a one-line digest ("● done in Ns · N
  tool calls") plus a bell, so a long unattended turn announces its completion.
- **Per-turn tool-call budget**: `tool_call_limit` (default 50; config +
  /settings "tool budget"; 0 = unlimited) caps how many tools a single turn runs
  before asking to continue — a runaway-loop guard so `/tools auto` can be left
  unattended. On the cap it raises a continue/stop confirm (via the existing
  callback); a stop ends the turn keeping the work so far, and non-interactive
  runs stop automatically. Insecure mode never interrupts.
- **Skills**: reusable, named instruction sets — a markdown file per skill (with
  optional name/description frontmatter) in `<home>/skills/` (user) or
  `./.agent/skills/` (project, overrides same-named user skill). `/skills` lists,
  `/skill <name>` activates one for the session (injected into the system prompt,
  so it survives compaction), `/skill off <name>` removes it; and a model-
  invocable `use_skill` tool whose description enumerates the available skills so
  the model can load the fitting one itself.
- **Word-boundary wrapping in multi-line input**: the multi-line prompt now wraps
  at spaces (like the transcript) instead of hard-breaking mid-word at the column
  limit; a single over-long word (URL/token) still hard-breaks. Byte ranges stay
  contiguous so cursor movement/editing are unaffected.
- **`/compact` progress bar**: the summarisation now streams, and the status line
  shows a live bar + rough percentage (`compacting [██░░░░] ~34%`) alongside the
  elapsed seconds — a rough estimate (summary ≈ 1/12 of the input, bounded) so you
  can gauge when the session will resume, not just that it isn't frozen.
- **Parallel tool calls**: when a model turn batches several read-only tools
  (read_file / grep / find_symbol / list_directory) they run concurrently on a
  bounded thread pool; results are recorded in the model's original order. Any
  write / command / side-effecting call in the batch forces the whole batch back
  to serial. `parallel_tools` config, default on.
- **Prompt caching**: Anthropic/Claude requests mark `cache_control: ephemeral`
  breakpoints on the stable prefix — the tools, the system prompt and the last
  message (incremental multi-turn caching) — so repeat context is cheap (~10%) and
  faster on cache hits. Claude keeps the CLI-identity system block first and caches
  the rest. OpenAI/Kimi/DeepSeek cache automatically server-side, so no change
  there. `prompt_cache` config / `/settings prompt_cache on|off`, default on.
- **Bulk `read_file`**: a `paths` array reads several files in one call (each
  under a `===== path =====` header, sharing one output budget; a missing file is
  noted and the rest still read), cutting tool round-trips. Single-file
  `path` + `offset`/`limit` windowing unchanged.
- **`fetch_url`**: fetch an http/https page and return its text — HTML reduced to
  readable text (`html_to_text`: drop script/style/comments, block tags → line
  breaks, tags stripped, named + numeric entities decoded, whitespace tidied).
  Complements `web_search` (find a link, then read it) and is the offline-model's
  way to read docs. Uses `Client::get`; gated by the same network toggle as
  `web_search`; only http/https allowed.
- **`run_command` options**: per-call `timeout` (seconds, clamped; default 120,
  max 600), `cwd` (runs inside `cd <dir> && ( ... )`), and `env` (extra vars for
  that command only, applied via `env_cpp`'s RAII `env_scope` so the parent
  environment is restored afterwards). Pulls in **`env_cpp`** (oskarirauta/env_cpp
  v1.0.0) as a submodule — a small read/write environment library with a
  json_cpp-style subscript API.
- **`edit_file`**: targeted edit tool — replace an exact `old_string` with
  `new_string` in an existing file (`replace_all` optional; unique-match enforced
  otherwise), or pass an **`edits` array** to apply several replacements in one
  atomic call (sequential; if any fails the file is left unchanged). Cheaper/safer
  than rewriting the whole file; danger-classified and change-tracked like
  `write_file`. (Prefer over write_file for edits.)
- **`find_references`**: tree-wide whole-identifier usage search — where a symbol
  is *used* (call sites + definition), the counterpart to `find_symbol` (which
  finds the definition). More precise than `grep` (whole-word, so `foo` skips
  `foobar`); skips build/vendor dirs and binaries; reports the reference and line
  counts.
- **`/export [file]`**: write the whole conversation to a Markdown file (system /
  you / assistant / tool-result sections, assistant tool calls noted) for bug
  reports, sharing and docs. Defaults to `agent-export-<timestamp>.md`.
- **Change tracking (`/changes` + revert)**: a Registry pre-run hook snapshots a
  file's pre-write content (session-start state, size-capped) before `write_file`
  overwrites it. `/changes` lists created/modified/reverted files with a line
  delta; `/changes diff <path>` shows a block diff; `/changes revert <path|all>`
  restores the original (or removes a session-new file). The useful core of the
  "snapshot" idea without full filesystem snapshots.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) support**: connect to MCP servers defined in
  `mcp.json` / `.mcp.json` — **stdio** (`{command,args,env}`, own fork/exec +
  persistent-pipe transport) and **HTTP** (`{url,headers}`, Streamable HTTP with
  `Mcp-Session-Id` + json-or-SSE responses). JSON-RPC 2.0 initialize handshake,
  then `tools/list` + (by capability) `resources/list` + `prompts/list`. Each
  server tool is exposed as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (schema passed through);
  **resources** get a per-server `mcp__<server>__read_resource(uri)` tool;
  **prompts** load via `/mcp prompt <server> <name> [k=v]` (injected into context).
  Servers connect **in parallel** at startup (bounded by the slowest handshake),
  killed/reaped on exit. `/mcp` lists servers/tools/resources/prompts + status;
  `/mcp refresh` re-lists a server whose offerings changed. Follow-up left:
  automatic push refresh on `notifications/tools/list_changed` (needs a background
  reader thread) — `/mcp refresh` covers it manually.
- **`web_search` tool**: queries DuckDuckGo (html endpoint) and returns the top
  results (title, URL, snippet) for the model to read and cite. Especially useful
  for **local models (Ollama/llama.cpp)** with no MCP search server — it gives an
  otherwise-offline model a way to fetch facts beyond its training data and the
  project files. On by default; `web_search: false` (config) or `/settings
  web_search off` disables it; `web_search_url` overrides the endpoint. Added
  `Client::get` (follows redirects) for it; parser is HTML-scrape based (decodes
  the `uddg=` redirect, strips tags/entities). (Once MCP lands, an MCP search
  server can also provide this.)
- **`find_symbol` tool** (light codebase search): a definition-aware, tree-wide
  symbol search — give an identifier and it returns where it is *defined*
  (class/struct/enum/def/fn/type or a C-family `NAME(...)` opening), skipping call
  sites (lines ending in `;`) and build/vendor dirs. Always fresh (no persistent
  index to go stale), a precise complement to `grep`. The heavier options
  (embeddings / vector search) stay out of scope — grep + this cover the need.
- **Cost / token budget**: per-model pricing from config (`price.<model>: <in>/<out>`
  USD per million tokens) drives an estimated session cost shown on the status line
  and via `/cost`. `budget_usd` / `budget_tokens` (config or `/cost budget|tokens`)
  emit a one-shot warning at 80% and 100%. Unpriced models (flat-rate
  subscriptions) show token usage only. Built on `TokenStats`; no built-in prices
  so nothing goes stale.

## Done — final release cycle

Everything below shipped in the run-up to the 1.0-quality release; kept here as a
record of what was completed and why. There is no outstanding "planned" work — the
only forward-looking section is **ROADMAP TO V2** at the bottom.

- **Menu-framework modernisation** (one coherent pass, grouped style from mockups):
  1. ✅ Modernise the `/settings` menu — grouped sections, per-row help line,
     ‹enum›, arrow-adjust numbers with unit + `0 = all/unlimited`, clearer labels
     (the opaque "preview" is now "paste preview … N lines (0 = all)").
  2. ✅ Local/display commands run immediately mid-turn (not queued), like
     `/queue`: /about /info /help /theme /settings /workflows /trust /history
     /memories /tasks /skills /pins /context /cost /changes /mcp. Mutating ones
     still queue. poll_worker holds streaming back while a modal menu is up.
  3. ✅ `/workflows` into a scrollable list menu (Enter drills into a run's
     steps) — a shared list/reader component.
  4. ✅ Menu-as-reader for `/history`, `/memories`, `/tasks`, `/skills`, and a
     `/queue` list menu with a drop action key — all on the same component.
  5. ✅ `/model` opens a picker of common models for the provider (curated + the
     active model; typing still reaches anything else).
  6. ✅ `/effort` (and `/thinking`) as a picker menu.
  ✅ Also done: list-menu action keys (`/queue` drop, `/workflows` cancel/retry),
  mini pickers for the toggle/enum settings (`/tools` `/stream` `/strict` `/plan`
  `/bell`), word-wrapped scrollable detail view, and theme-aware menu colours.
  ✅ Live model-list fetch: `/model` pulls the provider's real models
  (Ollama `/api/tags` for local models, OpenAI/Anthropic `/v1/models`), curated
  fallback otherwise.
- **`/bell` setting** — ✅ done (never|question|attention|always).
- **`/paste [n]`** — ✅ done: review the large pastes sent this session
  (scrollable, word-wrapped).
- **more providers** — ✅ effectively covered: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  works via `provider: openai` + `api_url` (Groq/Mistral/DeepSeek/Gemini-compat/
  xAI/Together, several free) — documented in the README. Native set: OpenAI,
  Ollama, Anthropic, Moonshot, OpenRouter, Kimi, Claude.
- **Security hardening** (from an external audit) — **done**: `/export` stays
  inside home/cwd; CI runs the test suite; a project `./.mcp.json` is untrusted
  and its servers need per-server confirmation before spawning; `fetch_url`
  flags link-local / cloud-metadata targets for confirmation (SSRF guard, while
  localhost/dev stays frictionless); the version comes from one header. Most
  other audit items were false positives or by-design (allowlist `classify_safe`,
  whole-exchange `undo_last`, caught tool exceptions, delegating `/settings`).

### Release-completion feature list (from the ultracode feature-shortlist)

Working toward a long-lived "actually finished" release; going through each:

- ✅ **ask_user tool + bell level** — the model can pause and ask you a decision
  (menu or free text); new `ask_user` bell level rings only for that.
- ✅ **Interruptible run_command** — Ctrl-C stops the command but keeps its
  partial output in context instead of undoing the exchange.
- ✅ **`/raw`** — inspect the exact last request/response (JSON).
- ✅ **`/limits`** — the provider's rate-limit / quota headers from the last call.
- ✅ **Background commands** (`run_command background:true` + `/jobs` + check_job)
  — run a dev server / `tail -f` without blocking the turn.
- ✅ **Secret redaction** — credentials in tool output are masked before being
  sent to the provider (`redact_secrets`, on by default).
- ✅ **Compound-command safety** (raised mid-review) — the danger classifier and
  the allow-similar key now inspect every stage, so `cd /tmp && rm -rf /` can't
  slip through as "cd".
- ✅ **Stale-read guard** — write_file/edit_file refuse to clobber a file that
  changed on disk since the model read it (shared FileTracker).
- ✅ **Cross-provider failover** — `failover: a,b` retries a hard-failed turn on
  the next configured, logged-in provider before anything streams.
- ✅ **`--output-format json`** — scriptable headless mode: `-o json` emits one JSON
  object (response + provider/model + usage) on stdout.

### Final adversarial code review

- ✅ A multi-agent review (16 subsystem reviewers, each finding verified by an
  independent skeptic) swept the whole tree for bugs and complexity. All confirmed
  findings were fixed across 7 batches: **4 critical** (a use-after-free on
  cross-provider failover; an SSRF IPv4-mapped-IPv6 bypass; the Anthropic
  parallel-tool alternation 400; Ollama streaming that dropped every reply),
  **~24 further bugs** (background-job concurrency, danger-classifier bypasses,
  atomic file writes + normalised edit matching, ask_user teardown deadlock,
  short-terminal settings viewport, provider/MCP/auth edge cases) and **7 perf
  fixes** (single-pass redaction + ReDoS guard, grep size cap, search pre-filters).
  Removed a dead, key-logging `create_claude_api_key` helper. Documentation, usage,
  `-Wall`-clean build, `make release`/`make tests`, and the test suite (609 tests)
  round it out.

## Done — v2.0.0 cycle

- ✅ **Workflows view redesign — a multi-level drill-down menu.** `/workflows` is
  now hierarchical: runs → steps → the single step's content (the model's run_workflow
  is runs+steps, so there is no separate "phase" level). Each level is a short page
  with a status glyph (✔ done / ▸ running / ○ pending / ✗ error / ∅ cancelled) and
  badges (`[N steps]`, `done/total`, `∥` for parallel). Enter drills down, Esc goes
  up a level (closes at the top); `c`/`r` cancel/retry a run in place. `/workflows <id>`
  stays as a deep-link. Built from the live snapshot so progress updates.
- ✅ **Overlay-style bounded menus.** The list/reader panel was drawn at nearly full
  screen height, scrolling the conversation out of view. It is now capped to a modest
  height so it sits at the bottom with the transcript still visible above — within the
  native-scrollback design (no alternate screen).
- ✅ **Two more colour themes** — `cool` (blues + greens) and `rose` (muted
  mauve/pink), alongside dark/light/warm.
- ✅ **Fixes:** the turn-status blank-line regression (a multi-line command flattened
  in the live status); the tool confirmation mode now persists across sessions (with a
  CLI-flag guard); `edit_file` gives a clear error on a missing/null path instead of
  "file does not exist: null".

## ROADMAP TO V3

Speculative — a sketch, not a commitment (and it remains to be seen whether v3 ever
happens).

- **Multi-agent cloud orchestration.** Today's `/workflows` runs each step as a
  sub-agent on a background *thread* of the one local process; results fold into the
  conversation on the next turn. v3 would distribute that:
  - **Remote workers.** A step is dispatched to a worker process/host instead of a
    local thread. Each sub-agent already carries its own client/provider/conversation
    and OAuth, so the unit of work is self-contained; what is missing is a transport
    (dispatch a step + stream its result back) and worker lifecycle.
  - **A coordinator.** Schedules steps across N workers with real parallelism at scale
    (beyond one machine's core count), handles worker failure/retry, and enforces a
    global budget.
  - **Live push.** Step results stream back and surface in the UI as they land, rather
    than the current pull-view + next-turn fold-in.
  - **Nested workflows.** A step could itself launch a workflow (bounded), for
    decompose-and-conquer over large tasks.
  This is a separate, much larger project than the local take; the local `/workflows`
  is deliberately the lightweight version and stays useful on its own.

## Considered / dropped

Deliberately out — either covered by something we already have, or low return for
a coding tool (it's a tool, not a toy).

- **Native git tools** — the auto-safe `run_command` already runs read-only git
  (`status/diff/log/show`); a commit-with-confirm wrapper is marginal over that.
- **Auto-fix loop** (build/test fail → fix → retry) — already emergent: the model
  sees the failing tool output and iterates. Better nudged via `AGENTS.md` than a
  hard-coded loop.
- **Linter / formatter / test-runner tools** — `run_command` + an `AGENTS.md` line
  ("run `clang-format` / `make test` after edits") covers it; or an MCP server.
- **Code eval** (`python -c`, `node -e`, regex tester) — `run_command` already does
  this.
- **Refactoring tools** (rename / extract / move) — `edit_file` (+ multi-edit) +
  `find_references` + `grep` cover the practical need; full semantic refactors are
  high-effort and low-reliability in plain text.
- **File watch / auto-run on change** — niche for an interactive CLI.
- **Command macros / snippets / templates** — prompt history + `AGENTS.md` conventions
  cover most of it.
- **Multi-agent cloud orchestration** — the local `/workflows` is the lightweight
  take; full cloud orchestration is a separate project.
- **Internal commands** replacing busybox coreutils — high effort, uncertain uptake;
  prefer clean errors + date-in-context.
- **Filesystem snapshots before dangerous ops** — `/changes` + revert covers the
  useful part far more cheaply.
- **Custom tools defined in config** — largely `run_command` sugar.
- **Named session save/load** — history is already auto-saved per provider *and*
  per project dir; named parallel sessions are a minor add.
- **Image input** — provider-dependent, little use in a text CLI.
